# Ice-Gaming-Store_5thProject
This project is my 1st integrated project for sprint 1 - 4.

In this srpint I am trying to apply all the knowledge that I have learned in Sprints 1-4.

# Project Overview

As an analyst at the online gaming store 'Ice', I have been tasked with identifying patterns that can determine whether a video game will be successful or not. By doing so, I can find the most potential games to recommend and plan their advertising campaigns. The following is the conclusion that I have drawn after working on the project.

Based on the observation and visualization, here are some findings that I obtained :
1.	A platform's popularity will decline after 7 years after reaching its peak, which was typically around $100 million in annual sales. However, a platform's popularity can also increase depending on the company that develops it. The PS platform, for example, tends to boom after 2 years, while the Wii and X360 products may take up to 5 years to increase in popularity.
2.	The rating from critics and game users can be said donâ€™t have a strong correlation with sales.
3.	Each region has different platform usage preferences, as follows:    
    -	NA = X360, PS2, Wii, PS3, and DS     
    -	EU = PS2, PS3, X360, Wii, and PS     
    -	JP = DS, PS, PS2, SNES, and 3DS
4.	Each region has similar genre preferences, as follows:     
    -	NA = Action, Sports, Shooter, Platform, Misc     
    -	EU = Action, Sports, Shooter, Racing, Misc     
    -	JP = Role-Playing, Action, Sports, Platform, Misc

Based on the analysis, the marketing team can consider the following recommendations:

1.	Platform Selection: Based on the data, it is recommended to focus on promoting games on the PS4 and XOne platforms, as they are still showing growth in sales.
2.	Genre and Rating Selection: It is recommended to focus on promoting games in the "Action" genre with an "E (Everyone)" rating, especially in the North American market. This genre and rating combination has shown consistent popularity across all regions.
3.	Regional Preferences: It is important to consider the different preferences in platform usage and genre across regions.
4.	Timing of Promotion: Based on the observation, promoting games on platforms that have been out for a longer time, such as the PS4 and XOne, could be more beneficial than promoting games on newer platforms.
